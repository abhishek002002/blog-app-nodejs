# blog-app-nodejs
a simple blog app with node.js

I am currently doing a 90 day coding challenge. 
I have decided on building a blog app from scratch using node.js.



to run blog
1. start /server/app.js -- this is will run backend, sets up the api routes, then we can use it to save/pull blog posts.
   will need to prodvide mongodb ip to connect to in app.js
2. start npm start, in folder /client -- this will run webpack server and serve frontend.

note to self: need to setup environmental variables, currently some of the api urls and mongodb are hardcoded.

view demo here http://khanhthai.com:3001/ -- will be integrated into my personal site soon.
